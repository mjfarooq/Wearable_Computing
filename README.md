Project of Course "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The objecive of the project is to create a tidy data set by combinig several data files. The final data set contains the following columns:

- Subject

- Activity

- Mean of triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.

- Standard Deviation of triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.

- Mean of triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 

- Standard Deviation of triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.

The resulting data set is stored in the file "Tidy_data_set.txt"
